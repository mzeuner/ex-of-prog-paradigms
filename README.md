# Examples of Programming Paradigms

The code examples in this repository grew out of live programming sessions for the
[Programeringsparadigm](https://www.su.se/sok-kurser-och-program/da4003-1.512355)
given at Stockholm University.

Note that these are addressed at students that not have previously used any of the
languages present here. To this end only very basic data structures are used
(e.g. lists in Haskell and Prolog).
